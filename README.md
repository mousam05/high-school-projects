# high-school-projects

Mini games and other programs written in high school

Note: Turbo C++ IDE was used to compile and run the programs. Many non-standard header files have been used which may not be available on most modern systems. (e.g. iostream.h, conio.h etc)

Please ignore the bad coding style wherever possible!
